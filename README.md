## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

WineEnthusiast compiles comprehensive reviews of most wines and includes information such as country/region of origin, variety, and reviewer descriptions. This project will explore the data to answer three questions to help answer the larger question: Is it possible for wineries to use this data to help them price their wines?

The three questions we will focus on:

1. What are the origins and varieties of wine with the highest pricing?
2. What reviewer descriptors are linked to the highest priced wines?
3. Can we create a model that predicts an optimal price?
